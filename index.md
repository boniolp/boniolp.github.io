## Short bio

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
I am a Postdoctoral researcher at the University of Paris in the LIPADE lab. I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Paris and EDF R&D, working with [Prof. Themis Palpanas](http://helios.mi.parisdescartes.fr/~themisp/), Emmanuel Remy, and Mohammed Meftah. Before that, I got my bachelor’s and master’s degrees in computer science and applied mathematics from Grenoble INP ENSIMAG engineering school. Finally, before starting my Ph.D., I worked as a research engineer at the computer science lab of Ecole Polytechnique in [Prof. Michalis Vazirgiannis](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Michalis.Vazirgiannis/)'s team.
</p>
My research interest lies in the intersections between:
-  Massive data series analytics and management systems. 
-  Unsupervised and supervised anomaly detection methods for large data series.
-  Machine learning for data series classification.
