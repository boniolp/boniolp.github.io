## Intro

I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Paris and EDF R&D, working with [Prof. Themis Palpanas](http://helios.mi.parisdescartes.fr/~themisp/), Emmanuel Remy, and Mohammed Meftah. Before that, I got my bachelor’s and master’s degrees in computer science and applied mathematics from Grenoble INP ENSIMAG engineering school. Finally, before starting my Ph.D., I worked as a research engineer at the computer science lab of Ecole Polytechnique in [Prof. Michalis Vazirgiannis](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Michalis.Vazirgiannis/)'s team.

My research interest lies in the intersections between (i). massive data series analytics and management systems, and (ii). Unsupervised and supervised anomaly detection and prediction methods for large data series.
